# Digit_Recognition_Neural_Network_FromScratch
This project implements a simple fully connected feedforward neural network from scratch to classify digits from the MNIST dataset. The neural network is built using basic Python and numpy, without any deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch.
